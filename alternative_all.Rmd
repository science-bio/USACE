<h3><strong>Alternative</strong></h3>
<h3>Project Delivery Process</h3>

<p>An <strong>alternative</strong> process for a USACE project can be done through general authorities previously granted by Congress to USACE. These general authorities allow USACE to undertake activities without requiring additional congressional authorization including emergency actions related to flooding and limited actions in response to drought. Congress also provides permission to the USACE to undertake projects under the Continuing Authorities Program. </p>

<p>These are <strong>four main</strong> authorities that fall into the alternative project delivery process. Keep in mind that this is not a comprehensive list. </p>

<h3> 1.Continuing Authorities Program</h3>
<br>
<p>The Corps’ authorities to undertake small projects are called <strong>Continuing Authorities Programs (CAPs)</strong>. Projects under these authorities can be conducted without project-specific congressional study or construction authorization and without project-specific appropriations.</p>

<p>Completion of CAP projects can take less time to fulfill. In general, CAP projects can take three years from feasibility phase initiation to construction completion.</p>

<p>The following is a flowchart for the CAP process. </p>

<h3>2.Environmental Infrastructure Assistance</h3>
<br>
<p>Congress has authorized and provided for USACE assistance with design and construction of municipal drinking water and wastewater infrastructure projects. This assistance has included treatment facilities, such as recycling and desalination plants; distribution and collection works, such as stormwater collection and recycled water distribution; and surface water protection and development projects. This assistance is broadly labeled <strong>environmental infrastructure</strong> at USACE but is also known as <strong>Section 219</strong>. </p>

<p>Most USACE environmental infrastructure assistance is authorized for a specific geographic location (e.g., city, county, multiple counties).</p>

<p>Most USACE environmental infrastructure assistance requires cost sharing, typically designated at 75% federal and 25% nonfederal; however, some of the assistance authorities are for 65% federal and 35% nonfederal cost sharing. Under Section 219, USACE performs the authorized work; for environmental infrastructure projects authorized in other provisions, USACE often can use appropriated funds to reimburse nonfederal sponsors for work they perform.</p>

<p>Because environmental infrastructure activities are not traditional USACE water resource projects, they are not subject to USACE planning process (e.g., a benefit-cost analysis and feasibility study are not performed). USACE environmental infrastructure assistance activities, however, are subject to federal laws, such as NEPA.</p>

<h3>2. Flood Fighting and Emergency Response</h3>
<br>
<p>Congress has given USACE its own emergency response authority. This is commonly referred to as the agency’s <strong>P.L. 84-99 authority</strong>.</p>

<p>The act authorizes USACE to perform emergency response and disaster assistance. It also authorizes disaster preparedness, advance measures, emergency operations (disaster response and post-flood response), rehabilitation of certain damaged flood control works, protection or repair of certain federally authorized shore protection works threatened by coastal storms, emergency dredging, and flood-related rescue operations. These activities are limited to actions to save lives and protect improved property (public facilities/services and residential or commercial developments). USACE also has some authorities to assist with selected activities during drought</p>

<h3>3. Rehabilitation and Inspection Program (RIP)</h3>
<br>
<p>Under the Rehabilitation and Inspection Program (RIP), the Corps is authorized to rehabilitate damaged flood control works (e.g., levees) and federally constructed hurricane or shore protection projects (e.g., federal beach nourishment projects) and to conduct related inspections. </p>

<p>To be eligible for rehabilitation assistance, the project must be in active status at the time of damage by wind, wave, or water action other than ordinary nature. </p>

<p>For locally constructed projects, 80% of the cost to repair the damage is paid using federal funds and 20% is paid by the levee or dam owner. For federally constructed projects, the entire repair cost is a federal responsibility (except the nonfederal sponsor is responsible for the cost of obtaining the sand or other material used in the repair). For damage to be repaired, USACE must determine that repair has a favorable benefit-cost ratio. Local sponsor assume any rehabilitation cost for damage to an active project attributable to deficient maintenance. WRDA 2016 allows that in conducting repair or restoration work under RIP, an increase in the level of protection can be made if the nonfederal sponsor pays for the additional protection.</p>
