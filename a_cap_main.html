<h3>Continuing Authorities Program</h3>

<p>The Corpsâ€™ authorities to undertake small projects are called <strong>Continuing Authorities Programs (CAPs)</strong>. Projects under these authorities can be conducted without project-specific congressional study or construction authorization and without project-specific appropriations.</p>

<p>Completion of CAP projects can take less time to fulfill. In general, CAP projects can take three years from feasibility phase initiation to construction completion.</p>

<p>The following is a flowchart for the CAP process. </p>
