<h3><strong>USACE Civil Works</strong></h3>

<h3>Summary</h3>

<p>The Corps began with improving and regulating navigation channels, but Congress expanded the Corps’ workload by authorizing the agency to reduce flood damage, and restore aquatic ecosystems. Federal involvement through the Corps in these water resource development activities is directed by Congress through authorization and appropriations legislation. <strong>Congress often considers Corps authorization legislation biennially and appropriations annually</strong>. Authorization for Corps studies and projects are generally required before eligibility for federal appropriations. The Corps undertakes water resource development activities principally through the Civil Works program. This involvement attracts congressional attention because it can have significant local and regional economic benefits and environmental effects.</p>

<h3>Mission </h3>

<p>There are <strong>three primary mission areas</strong> at the heart of the USACE Civil Works Program. </p>

<ol>
	<li> <strong>Flood Risk Management</strong></li>
	<li><strong>Navigation</strong></li>
	<li><strong>Ecosystem Restoration</strong></li>
</ol>

<p>Congress has also directed the Corps Civil Works Program to address recreation, hydropower, and coastal storm risk management. However, the<strong> Corps involvement in these areas generally requires for the projects to be associated with one or more of the three major primary mission areas</strong>. </p>

<h3>Partnerships</h3>

<p>Civil works are carried out through partnerships between the Corps and a <strong>non-Federal entity</strong>. These partnerships are multifaceted and can vary by the scope and scale of the project being developed. A non-federal entity can be a state government, a county or local government, a tribe, or an agency.</p>

<h3>Criteria </h3>

<p><strong>All civil works projects must meet certain fundamental criteria;</strong></p>

<ol>
	<li> Each project must go through a detailed planning process that is guided by laws and regulation</li>
	<li> Each project must comply with other applicable federal and state environmental laws</li>
	<li> Each project and project study must be authorized by Congress</li>
	<li> Moneys for each project and project study must be approved by Congress</li>
	<li> Almost every project must have a non-federal sponsor who pays for a portion of the project’s costs.</li>
</ol>
