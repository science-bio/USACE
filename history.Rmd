<h3><strong>US Army Corps of Engineers</strong></h3>
<br>
<h3>History</h3>
<p>The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (Corps) can be traced back more than 200 years. In its conception during the American Revolution, the Second Continental Congress organized the Continental Army with General George Washington as commander-in-chief and Colonel Richard Gridley as Chief Engineer. During these first years, engineers in the Continental Army worked solely on military projects. In 1779, Congress recognized the need of engineers and established a separate Corps of Engineers. As the war to independence ended, the Corps was disbanded but was later re-established during the Presidency of George Washington. In 1802 Thomas Jefferson signed the Military Peace Establishment Act where he recognized the Corps into the organization we know today. </p>

<h3>19th Century</h3>

<p>Throughout the nineteenth century, the industrialization of the United States increased the use of rivers and roads as paths of commerce. As a result, both commercial development and national defense required improvements in transportation. Federal assistance for “internal improvements” was slowed down by concerns of unconstitutional federal intrusions into state affairs. In 1824, the case of Gibbons v. Ogden, decided by the US Supreme Court, granted Congress the power to regulate interstate commerce, including the commercial use of navigable waterways. That same year, Congress passed the General Survey Act, authorizing the president to survey roads and canals. President James Monroe assigned this responsibility to the Corps. A moth after the passage of the General Survey Act, Congress appropriated $75,000 to improve navigation on the Ohio and Mississippi rivers. This legislation, known today as the first River and Harbors Act, was to be administered by the Cops, marking the beginning of the Corps’ permanent civil works construction mission. In 1826, a new River and Harbors Act was passed by Congress, authorizing the Corps to have surveys made to clean out and deepen selected waterways in addition to making various river and harbors improvements. This 1826 legislative piece was the first to combine authorizations for both surveys and projects, thereby establishing a legislative pattern of authorizing Corps surveys and individual projects together. </p>

<h3>20th Century</h3>

<p>The twentieth century marked an expansion of the Corps workload by including flood damage reduction control. (Comment: I need to include more details maybe no more than 100 words)</p>

<h3>21st Century</h3>

<p>The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers today, is an executive branch agency within the Department of Defense and a Major Command within the Army. The Corp is the primary federal manager of the nation’s water resources and helps build – and maintain – much of the nation’s navigation and flood damage reduction infrastructure. </p>
