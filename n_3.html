<h3>3. Rehabilitation and Inspection Program (RIP)</h3>

<p>Under the Rehabilitation and Inspection Program (RIP), the Corps is authorized to rehabilitate damaged flood control works (e.g., levees) and federally constructed hurricane or shore protection projects (e.g., federal beach nourishment projects) and to conduct related inspections. </p>

<p>To be eligible for rehabilitation assistance, the project must be in active status at the time of damage by wind, wave, or water action other than ordinary nature. </p>

<p>For locally constructed projects, 80% of the cost to repair the damage is paid using federal funds and 20% is paid by the levee or dam owner. For federally constructed projects, the entire repair cost is a federal responsibility (except the nonfederal sponsor is responsible for the cost of obtaining the sand or other material used in the repair). For damage to be repaired, USACE must determine that repair has a favorable benefit-cost ratio. Local sponsor assume any rehabilitation cost for damage to an active project attributable to deficient maintenance. WRDA 2016 allows that in conducting repair or restoration work under RIP, an increase in the level of protection can be made if the nonfederal sponsor pays for the additional protection.</p>
