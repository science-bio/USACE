<h3>2. Flood Fighting and Emergency Response</h3>

<p>Congress has given USACE its own emergency response authority. This is commonly referred to as the agencyâ€™s <strong>P.L. 84-99 authority</strong>.</p>

<p>The act authorizes USACE to perform emergency response and disaster assistance. It also authorizes disaster preparedness, advance measures, emergency operations (disaster response and post-flood response), rehabilitation of certain damaged flood control works, protection or repair of certain federally authorized shore protection works threatened by coastal storms, emergency dredging, and flood-related rescue operations. These activities are limited to actions to save lives and protect improved property (public facilities/services and residential or commercial developments). USACE also has some authorities to assist with selected activities during drought</p>
